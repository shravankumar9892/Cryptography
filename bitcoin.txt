(1) GENERAL: 
Users can transfer bitcoin over the network to do just about anything that can be done with conventional currencies, including buy and sell goods, send money to people or organizations, or extend credit. Bitcoin can be purchased, sold, and exchanged for other currencies at specialized currency exchanges. Bitcoin in a sense is the perfect form of money for the internet because it is fast, secure, and borderless.

(2) KEYS: 
Users of bitcoin own keys that allow them to prove ownership of bitcoin in the bitcoin network. With these keys they can sign transactions to unlock the value and spend it by transferring it to a new owner. Keys are often stored in a digital wallet on each user’s computer or smartphone. Possession of the key that can sign a transaction is the only prerequisite to spending bitcoin, putting the control entirely in the hands of each user.

(3) MINING:
Bitcoin are created through a process called "mining," which involves competing to find solutions to a mathematical problem while processing bitcoin transactions. Any participant in the bitcoin network (i.e., anyone using a device running the full bitcoin protocol stack) may operate as a miner, using their computer’s processing power to verify and record transactions. Every 10 minutes, on average, a bitcoin miner is able to validate the transactions of the past 10 minutes and is rewarded with brand new bitcoin. Essentially, bitcoin mining decentralizes the currency-issuance and clearing functions of a central bank and replaces the need for any central bank.

(4) HOW CAN EVERY TRANSACTION GET VALIDATED?
The difficulty of the processing task that miners must perform is adjusted dynamically so that, on average, someone succeeds every 10 minutes regardless of how many miners (and how much processing) are competing at any moment.

(5) WHY IS IT WORTH INVESTING ON BITCOIN?
The protocol also halves the rate at which new bitcoin are created every 4 years, and limits the total number of bitcoin that will be created to a fixed total just below 21 million coins by 2140. Due to bitcoin’s diminishing rate of issuance, over the long term, the bitcoin currency is deflationary(it's value increases).

(6) BITCOIN CONSISTS OF:
- A decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol)

- A public transaction ledger (the blockchain)

- A set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency issuance (consensus rules)

- A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus on the valid blockchain (Proof-of-Work algorithm)

(7) UESTIONS FOR ANYONE ACCEPTING DIGTITAL MONEY ARE?

- Can I trust that the money is authentic and not counterfeit?

- Can I trust that the digital money can only be spent once (known as the “double-spend” problem)?

- Can I be sure that no one else can claim this money belongs to them and not me?

(8) WHY SHOULD BITCOIN BE PREFERRED?
 Bitcoin’s total market value has at times exceeded $135 billion US dollars, depending on the bitcoin-to-dollar exchange rate. The largest transaction processed so far by the network was $400 million US dollars, transmitted instantly and processed for a fee of $1. And in paytm, they ask 3 rupees for every 100 rupees, so for 400 M its 12 M, period!

(9) BITCOIN WALLETS:
A "bitcoin wallet" is the most common user interface to the bitcoin system, just like a web browser is the most common user interface for the HTTP protocol. There are many implementations and brands of bitcoin wallets, just like there are many brands of web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer).

*  There is also a reference implementation of the bitcoin protocol that includes a wallet, known as the "Satoshi Client" or "Bitcoin Core," which is derived from the original implementation written by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Many wallets focus on specific platforms or specific uses and some are more suitable for beginners while others are filled with features for advanced users. Choosing a wallet is highly subjective and depends on the use and user expertise. moving keys or seeds between bitcoin wallets is relatively easy, so it is worth trying out several different wallets until you find one that fits your needs.

(10) TYPES OF WALLETS:

* DESKTOP WALLETS: Running on general-use operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS has certain security disadvantages

* MOBILE WALLET: A mobile wallet is the most common type of bitcoin wallet. Many are designed for simplicity and ease-of-use, but there      are also fully featured mobile wallets for power users.

* WEB WALLET: Web wallets are accessed through a web browser and store the user’s wallet on a server owned by a third party. It is inadvisable to store large amounts of bitcoin on third-party systems.

* HARDWARE WALLETS: Hardware wallets are devices that operate a secure self-contained bitcoin wallet on special-purpose hardware. These wallets are considered very secure and suitable for storing large amounts of bitcoin.

* PAPER WALLET: The keys controlling bitcoin can also be printed for long-term storage. These are known as paper wallets even though other materials (wood, metal, etc.) can be used. Offline storage is also often referred to as cold storage.

A Bitcoin wallet is like a wallet with cash. If you wouldn't keep a thousand dollars in your pocket, you might want to have the same consideration for your Bitcoin wallet. In general, it is a good practice to keep only small amounts of bitcoins on your computer, mobile, or server for everyday uses and to keep the remaining part of your funds in a safer environment.

(11) WAYS TO GET FIRST BITCOIN:

- Find a friend who has bitcoin and buy some from him or her directly. Many bitcoin users start this way. This method is the least complicated. One way to meet people with bitcoin is to attend a local bitcoin meetup listed at Meetup.com.

- Use a classified service such as localbitcoins.com to find a seller in your area to buy bitcoin for cash in an in-person transaction.

- Earn bitcoin by selling a product or service for bitcoin. If you are a programmer, sell your programming skills. If you’re a hairdresser, cut hair for bitcoin.

- Use a bitcoin ATM in your city. A bitcoin ATM is a machine that accepts cash and sends bitcoin to your smartphone bitcoin wallet. Find a bitcoin ATM close to you using an online map from Coin ATM Radar.

- Use a bitcoin currency exchange linked to your bank account. Many countries now have currency exchanges that offer a market for buyers and sellers to swap bitcoin with local currency. Exchange-rate listing services, such as BitcoinAverage, often show a list of bitcoin exchanges for each currency.

(12) MULTIPLE WALLETS FOR BITCOIN:

In order to exchange bitcoin for your national currency, you will often be required to provide proof of identity and banking information. Users should be aware that once a bitcoin address is attached to an identity, all associated bitcoin transactions are also easy to identify and track. This is one reason many users choose to maintain dedicated exchange accounts unlinked to their wallets.

(13) EVALUATING BITCOIN PRICE:

Bitcoin, like most other currencies, has a floating exchange rate. That means that the value of bitcoin vis-a-vis any other currency fluctuates according to supply and demand in the various markets where it is traded( unlike pegged system in countries like Nepal, etc). As such, the price tends to fluctuate minutely several times per second. A pricing service will aggregate the prices from several markets and calculate a volume-weighted average representing the broad market exchange rate of a currency pair (e.g., BTC/USD). 
* APPS/WEBSITES for exchange rates are:
  - Bitcoin Average
  - CoinCap
  - Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin Reference Rate

(14) THINGS RECEIVER WILL FACE WHEN RECEIVING BTC IN THEIR WALLET:

Assuming Joe is the sender and Alice is the receiver. Once Joe presses Send to transmit the transaction. Joe’s mobile bitcoin wallet constructs a transaction that assigns 0.10 BTC to the address provided by Alice, sourcing the funds from Joe’s wallet and signing the transaction with Joe’s private keys. This tells the bitcoin network that Joe has authorized a transfer of value to Alice’s new address. As the transaction is transmitted via the peer-to-peer protocol, it quickly propagates across the bitcoin network. In less than a second, most of the well-connected nodes in the network receive the transaction and see Alice’s address for the first time. Meanwhile, Alice’s wallet is constantly "listening" to published transactions on the bitcoin network, looking for any that match the addresses in her wallets. A few seconds after Joe’s wallet transmits the transaction, Alice’s wallet will indicate that it is receiving 0.10 BTC.

(15) CLEARING:

At first, Alice’s address will show the transaction from Joe as "Unconfirmed." This means that the transaction has been propagated to the network but has not yet been recorded in the bitcoin transaction ledger, known as the blockchain. To be confirmed, a transaction must be included in a block and added to the blockchain, which happens every 10 minutes, on average. In traditional financial terms this is known as clearing.
